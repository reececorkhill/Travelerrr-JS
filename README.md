# Travelerrr ðŸ—º
The official repository of Travelerrr - Check the weather as you travel, anywhere you go!

## Description

The motivation behind Travelerrr was that, as a traveler I needed to know the weather forecasts for places I'm planning on visiting. The main aim of this project was to have an application which would allow me to search for the place I'm planning on visiting to check the weather for the day I arrive and have a 5-day forecast, allowing me to plan how many day's I stay there for. Another aim was to be able to store a list of easily clickable buttons with my previous searches which, when clicked, would pull the forecasts for me - nice and simple! âœ…

I expected and encountered a few problems with this project, the main one being how would I get the data and how would I display it when clicking different buttons? ðŸ¤” The solution to this problem was to build the application using JavaScript, Jquery, dayJS and HTML (with Bootstrap) as these technologies would allow me to make API calls based on the input boxes text value and the text value of my previous search buttons. By using Local Storage, I was able to make the functionality a reality! ðŸ˜Ž
